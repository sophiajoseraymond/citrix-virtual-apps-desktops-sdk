### Brokeruniversalclaim Object
A UniversalClaim object stores the mapping between a Claim and a VirtualSID. A claim can be an arbitrary string up to 450 characters in length. Each Claim is mapped to a Virtual SID.  Virtual SIDs are generated by either taking a SHA256 hash of the claim, and storing the hash bytes in a SID format, or in the case of a SID string being used as a Claim, the SID is copied to the VirtualSid.


  * Claim (System.String) The Claim for this UniversalClaim mapping

  * DirectoryContext (System.String) The DirectoryContext associated with this UniversalClaim mapping

  * UniversalClaimsTenantContext (System.String) The UniversalClaimsTenantContext associated with this UniversalClaim mapping

  * VirtualSid (System.String) The VirtualSid for this UniversalClaim mapping

| Claim | The Claim for this UniversalClaim mapping | true | false |  |
| VirtualSid | The VirtualSid for this UniversalClaim mapping. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available.

| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
